* What was our goal?
Our goal was to create a machine learning model that can predict the
winner of each game in the NCAA March Madness Tournament. We
determined that if our model could accurately predict 50% or better
that it was successful.

* What is the March Madness Tournament?
March Madness is a collegiate basketball tournament that takes place
in the month of March. The teams in this tournament are the 64 best
teams in Division 1 college basketball(Wilco, 2023).

* Import data

Read in the csv file containing our data. Then printed the structure
and a table of the winners. You can see that the data set has 51
different variables.
#+begin_src R
  game_data <- read.csv('GameDataFixed.csv', header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
  str(game_data)
  table(game_data$winner)
#+end_src

* Results
 Our model had an acuracy of 70%. To see visualize these results, we took the predicted winners of each
 game in the 2019 tournament and compared it to the actual
 winners. The bracket below shows the results, and for the 2019
 tournament there was only an accuracy of 43%
